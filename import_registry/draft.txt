Import registry hooks in EPD
============================

At the end of April (2011), Travis and I were playing with Python import
hooks.  The goal was to create an import registry mechanism which would
allow multiple versions of a package to be installed and easily switching
between those versions.  The idea is not new, setuptools provides such a
mechanism by installing packages into egg directories and using the
easy-install.pth file.  However, as EPD packages are (as of EPD 5.0) not
being installed using setuptools anymore (because of all the problems we
had with it), we were looking for a better alternative.

Starting with EPD 7.1 (including EPD Free), we have added an import
hook registry mechanism to the core Python interpreter.  This mechanism
is useful for setting up different environments, i.e. Python runtime
environments in which a specific set of packages are importable.
For example, it is possible to set up one environment in which numpy 1.5.1
and pyzmq 2.1.7 are present, and another environment in which numpy 1.6.0
and no pyzmq is present.  This can be useful is may different scenarios,
e.g. testing ipython with or without different versions of optional
dependencies installed.  The alternative would be to set up multiple
Python interpreters and install the desired packages into each one.
virtualenv can help here, but adds it's own set of problems.

This mechanism is based on the not very well known sys.meta_path list
of finder objects, see PEP 302 for the original specification.  By
default sys.meta_path is an empty list, in any regular Python and EPD.
However, when adding a file <sys.prefix>/registry.txt (or setting the
environment variable EPDREGISTRY to a special registry file), the new
registry mechanism is activated, and sys.meta_path now contains an
instance of our new PackageRegistry object.  As sys.meta_path is
searched before any implicit default finders or sys.path, the
mechanism allows importing different modules (and packages) than the
ones installed into site-packages.  The PackageRegistry class is quite
simple.  Basically, the find_module method checks whether the module
name is contained in the registry, and the load_module method uses
imp.load_module for the actual importing.  The code can be found in
<sys.prefix>/lib/python2.7/custom_tools/hooks.py, which also defines a
main function for setting up the hook, which is called from Python's
site.py.

Let's return to the above example, suppose you want to have two environments:
env1: numpy 1.5.1, pyzmq 2.1.7
env2: numpy 1.6.0, no pyzmq

First, you need to download (or create) the corresponding eggs.  Now these
eggs need to be installed in a special location (not into site-packages,
or any other directory on the PYTHONPATH):

  $ egginst --hook numpy-1.5.1-2.egg
  $ egginst --hook numpy-1.6.0-4.egg
  $ egginst --hook pyzmq-2.1.7-1.egg

This will install the eggs into versioned directories in <sys.prefix>/pkgs.
During the install process egginst also creates a registry file for each
package, e.g. <sys.prefix>/pkgs/numpy-1.5.1-2/EGG-INFO/registry.txt.
Now simply concatenate the desired registry files to create the registry file
EPDREGISTRY is going to point to:

  $ cd <sys.prefix>
  $ cat pkgs/numpy-1.5.1-2/EGG-INFO/registry.txt > registry1.txt
  $ cat pkgs/pyzmq-2.1.7-1/EGG-INFO/registry.txt >> registry1.txt
  $ cp pkgs/numpy-1.6.0-4/EGG-INFO/registry.txt registry2.txt
  $ EPDREGISTRY=registry1.txt python
  >>> import numpy
  >>> numpy.__version__
  1.5.1
  >>> import pyzmq
  >>> exit()
  $ EPDREGISTRY=registry2.txt python
  >>> import numpy
  >>> numpy.__version__
  1.6.0
  >>> import pyzmq # this is supposed to fail
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ImportError: No module names pyzmq

The files registry1.txt and registry2.txt do not have to reside in sys.prefix,
they can be anywhere on your system.  All that is important is that
EPDREGISTRY points to their path.

We have tested the new import registry mechanism with all packages in EPD
and were initially considering to install all EPD packages in this manner.
However Robert Kern was against it, and we came to the realization that
he was right.  The multiversion directory layout for packages is not good
for development, as one is never really sure what versions are active.
This is the same reason I created egginst in the first place, with the
ability to install packages "splatted out" into site-packages and remove
them or upgrade them cleanly.
