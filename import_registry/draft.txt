Import registry hooks in EPD
============================

Starting with EPD 7.1 (including EPD Free), we have added an import
hook registry mechanism to the core Python interpreter.  This mechanism
is based on the not very well known sys.meta_path list of finder objects,
see PEP 302 for the original specification.  By default sys.meta_path is
an empty list, in any regular Python and EPD.  However, when adding a file
<sys.prefix>/registry.txt (or setting the environment variable EPDREGISTRY
to a special registry file), the new registry mechanism is activated, and
sys.meta_path now contains an instance of our new PackageRegistry object.
As sys.meta_path is searched before any implicit default finders or sys.path,
the mechanism allows importing different modules and packages than the ones
installed into site-packages.
