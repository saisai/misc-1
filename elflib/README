elflib
======

elflib is a Python library for working with ELF (Executable and Linking
Format) files.  Being implemented in pure Python, it is OS independent,
although only useful on operations systems which use ELF.


Note:
-----

The project Development Status is 1 - Planning, only very limited
functionality has been implemented so far.
